# Migrate ephemeral DJ models to inline CTEs

**Goal:** dissolve qualifying ephemeral `.model.json` files into the `ctes[]` array of their downstream consumer, then remove the now-redundant file. Mutate **only** the JSON sources of truth — the framework's sync engine regenerates the `.sql` / `.yml` artifacts.

**Reading order:** `.agents/dj/AGENTS.md` (Model Types, Inline CTEs, Important Conventions) → `.dj/schemas/model.cte.schema.json` + `model.materialization.schema.json` → this skill's `references/transformation-matrix.md` for per-type recipes.

## When this skill applies

- The user mentions migrating, inlining, refactoring, flattening, consolidating, collapsing, or removing ephemeral models.
- The user wants to "clean up redundant intermediate layers" or "standardize trivial transformations into CTEs".
- The user references a specific ephemeral `.model.json` and wants it absorbed by its downstream consumer.

## Workflow

- [ ] **1. Inventory ephemerals.** Use ripgrep to find candidates -- never iterate-and-parse every `.model.json` (context-budget poison). Search for **all four** forms:
  1. `rg -l '"materialization"\s*:\s*"ephemeral"' models/`
  2. `rg -l '"materialization"\s*:\s*\{\s*"type"\s*:\s*"ephemeral"' models/`
  3. `rg -l '"materialized"\s*:\s*"ephemeral"' models/`
  4. `stg_*` and `int_*` models with **no** `materialization` / `materialized` field at all -- staging and intermediate layers default to `ephemeral` in DJ.
- [ ] **2. Find consumers.** For each candidate, look up `target/manifest.json` `child_map["model.${project}.${ephemeral_name}"]`. Each entry is a downstream consumer node ID. Resolve the consumer's `.model.json` path from the manifest's `original_file_path` (or by ripgrep on the model name). If `manifest.json` is missing or stale, ask the user to run `DJ: Refresh Projects` first.
- [ ] **3. Classify.** Apply the **Qualification matrix** below. Tag each ephemeral as `Safe`, `Needs review`, or `Skip` with a one-line reason.
- [ ] **4. Plan the run.** Print a compact table to the user: ephemeral → consumer(s) → classification → reason. Wait for the user to confirm scope (all `Safe`, all `Safe + reviewed`, or a hand-picked subset).
- [ ] **5. Mutate.** For each approved candidate, apply the transformation rules below + the per-type recipe in `references/transformation-matrix.md`. **Use a JSONC-aware editor** (or a targeted string edit) so comments and trailing commas survive -- `JSON.stringify` round-tripping silently strips both and is explicitly forbidden by `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] **6. Verify the auto-sync (per file).** Saving a `.model.json` triggers the framework's file watcher, which debounces (`dj.syncDebounceMs`, default 1500ms) and then regenerates the consumer's `.sql` / `.yml`. **Wait ~2-3 seconds after each save**, then read the consumer's diagnostics (Problems tab / linter output) and spot-check the generated `.sql` for shape sanity. If a diagnostic appears, fix it before moving to the next ephemeral -- do not batch failures.
- [ ] **7. Full sync at the end of the batch.** Once every approved migration is applied, ask the user to run `DJ: Sync to SQL and YML` (command id `dj.command.jsonSync`) from the command palette. The agent cannot invoke VS Code commands directly, so this step requires a user action. The full sync catches cross-file dependencies the per-file watcher may not (e.g. a consumer whose own consumer hasn't re-synced since its select shape changed). Confirm the Problems tab is clean for **all** touched files before proceeding to cleanup.
- [ ] **8. Cleanup.** Only after the full sync runs cleanly **and** a final repo-wide ref sweep (`rg "<ephemeral_name>" --type json`) returns zero hits, **and** the user explicitly confirms: delete the ephemeral `.model.json` and its generated `.sql` / `.yml` siblings. The framework does **not** auto-delete the `.sql` / `.yml` siblings on a plain `.model.json` delete (that auto-cleanup only fires on renames), so the agent must remove them explicitly. If any consumer still refers to the ephemeral, leave the file in place and report which consumers remain.
- [ ] **9. Post-delete verification.** Deleting a `.model.json` does **not** re-run validation on every downstream model and does **not** refresh the dbt manifest. After the batch of deletions, ask the user to run **two** commands from the command palette: (a) `DJ: Sync to SQL and YML` -- re-validates every model and catches any stale ref to a deleted ephemeral that slipped past the ref sweep; (b) `DJ: Refresh Projects` (command id `dj.command.refreshProjects`) -- re-parses `target/manifest.json` so `child_map` no longer lists the deleted ephemerals. Skipping the refresh leaves a stale manifest, which causes any later run of this skill (or model / column lineage views) to see ghosts. The agent cannot invoke either command; both require a user action.

> **Why Lightdash is a hard skip, not a fixup.** CTEs are transient in-memory query stages; they don't surface as Lightdash-explorable tables or views. If you inline an ephemeral that carries Lightdash metadata, that metadata is permanently destroyed -- there is no equivalent place to relocate it. The framework's `validateCtes` in `src/services/modelValidation.ts` separately rejects `metrics` / `metrics_merge` on any CTE select.

## Transformation rules

For each `Safe`/approved migration, edit the consumer's `.model.json`:

1. **Add the CTE.** Insert a new entry at the end of the consumer's `ctes` array (instantiate the array if absent). The entry's `name` is the **short `name` field from the ephemeral's `.model.json`** -- not the full `<layer>__<group>__<topic>__<name>` model name. So for `int__capeng__swh__reportstats_union.model.json` with `"name": "reportstats_union"`, the CTE is named `reportstats_union`. Concise CTE names keep the consumer readable and match the existing in-repo CTE naming convention (CTE schema validates against `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`). Copy the ephemeral's `from`, `select`, `where`, `group_by`, `having`, and all `exclude_*` flags into this entry. **Drop** the ephemeral's identity fields (`type`, `group`, `topic`, `name`, `materialization` / `materialized`) and any model-level `lightdash` / `tags` / `meta` -- those have no analog on a CTE.
2. **Disambiguate name collisions.** Before adopting the short name, check the consumer's existing `ctes[].name` values and -- if you are inlining more than one ephemeral in the same pass -- the other inbound ephemerals' short names. On collision, fall back deterministically: try `<topic>_<name>` (e.g. `swh_reportstats_union`), then `<group>_<topic>_<name>`, then the full model name. Pick the shortest form that is unique within the consumer.
3. **Rewrite top-level `from`.** Change `"from": { "model": "<full_ephemeral_name>" }` → `"from": { "cte": "<short_cte_name>" }`. For `from.join[]` entries, change `"model"` → `"cte"` on the matching join target and swap in the short name. For `from.union.models`, move the entry into `from.union.ctes` using the short name.
4. **Rewrite bulk selects.** Anywhere the consumer's `select` has `{ "type": "all_from_model", "model": "<full_ephemeral_name>" }`, rewrite to `{ "type": "all_from_cte", "cte": "<short_cte_name>" }`. Same for `dims_from_model` → `dims_from_cte` and `fcts_from_model` → `fcts_from_cte`. Preserve any `include` / `exclude` arrays verbatim.
5. **Rewrite qualified expression references to the ephemeral.** If the consumer has any `expr` strings that reference the ephemeral by its full model name (e.g. `"int__sales__orders__enriched.amount * 100"`), rewrite the qualifier to the new short CTE name (`"enriched.amount * 100"`). Inner expressions that reference the ephemeral's **upstream models** (e.g. `"stg__sales__orders__standardized.col + 1"` inside the new CTE) stay untouched -- CTE join aliases mirror upstream model names exactly, so those continue to resolve.
6. **Preserve partition-filter behavior.** DJ auto-injects an `_ext_event_date_filter` predicate on CTEs that read from physical upstream models, and CTEs chained off other CTEs inherit the predicate recursively back to the root physical model. **If the ephemeral was intentionally running unpartitioned** (carried `exclude_date_filter: true`, or its source lacked the partition column), set `"exclude_date_filter": true` on the new CTE entry. Mirror any other `exclude_*` flags (`exclude_datetime`, `exclude_portal_partition_columns`, `exclude_framework_artifacts`, …) the ephemeral carried.
7. **Respect CTE ordering.** If you are inlining a chain of two or more ephemerals into a single consumer, list them in dependency order: a CTE can only reference CTEs that appear **before** it in the array. Walk the chain bottom-up (deepest ephemeral first).

See `references/transformation-matrix.md` for per-ephemeral-type recipes (`int_select_model`, `int_join_models`, `int_union_models`, and `int_rollup_model` as a "Needs review" case) plus the partition-filter checklist and the Heavy ephemeral appendix.

## Hard rules (DO NOT)

- **DO NOT** inline a `stg_select_source` or `stg_union_sources` ephemeral. The CTE `from` schema (`model.cte.schema.json`) has no `source` shape; the result will fail validation.
- **DO NOT** inline into a consumer whose `type` is **not** in the CTE-supporting set above.
- **DO NOT** inline any ephemeral that carries a `lightdash` block at the model or column level. Skip it and report; the Lightdash metadata cannot survive the transition.
- **DO NOT** move Lightdash `metrics` / `metrics_merge` onto a CTE select even on the consumer side -- those must live on the consumer's main `select`. `validateCtes` in `src/services/modelValidation.ts` enforces this.
- **DO NOT** drop the ephemeral's `exclude_*` partition flags during transformation -- carry them onto the new CTE entry.
- **DO NOT** delete the ephemeral `.model.json` until **every** entry in `child_map` is migrated **and** a final repo-wide ref scan returns zero hits **and** the user explicitly confirms.
- **DO NOT** use `JSON.stringify` (or any non-JSONC writer) to rewrite `.model.json` -- it strips comments and trailing commas. Use `jsonc-parser` modify ops, or perform targeted string edits that leave surrounding formatting intact.
- **DO NOT** hand-edit the generated `.sql` or `.yml` files -- they are framework outputs and regenerate on sync.

## Gotchas

- **Ephemeral chains (A → B → C all ephemeral)** absorbed into a single mart: inline bottom-up in dependency order (A first, then B referencing A, then C referencing B). The chain becomes a sequence in `ctes[]`. Watch for `from.cte` references inside the inlined CTEs -- those resolve correctly because the chain is now intra-model.
- **Multi-consumer migration is a one-way change** that duplicates the ephemeral's logic into each consumer's `ctes[]`. Surface this clearly to the user; future edits will need to touch every copy. Default to leaving multi-consumer ephemerals in place.
- **Generated `.sql` / `.yml` files are read-only and orphan on plain deletes.** The framework's post-sync cleanup only deletes generated artifacts when a `.model.json` is **renamed** -- on a plain delete (this skill's flow), the `.sql` and `.yml` siblings linger and must be removed by the agent. The watcher does fire on the JSON delete, but it only invalidates the cache; the corresponding sync becomes a no-op because there's no JSON to sync from.
- **Diagnostics in the Problems tab must clear after sync.** If a new diagnostic appears on the consumer (e.g. "CTE references an unknown column", "`fct` without `agg`"), the migration is incomplete -- revert or fix before deleting the ephemeral.
- **Don't race the sync debouncer.** Reading the consumer's `.sql` / `.yml` or diagnostics within ~1500ms of a save gives a stale snapshot -- you'll see the file's previous state and conclude the migration broke something that's actually fine. Always sleep 2-3 seconds after each save before reading downstream artifacts. The agent cannot invoke `DJ: Sync to SQL and YML` itself (no VS Code command access); the per-file watcher is what makes incremental verification possible.
- **Partition-predicate inheritance is recursive.** A CTE chained off another CTE resolves the predicate all the way back to the root physical model. Spot-check the generated SQL to confirm the resulting filters match the ephemeral's previous behavior, especially for any model that historically ran full-history scans.
- **Inlining a heavy ephemeral can regress query performance.** When a `mart_*` model is hit repeatedly (BI dashboards, downstream tests), the inlined logic recalculates per call instead of once per dbt run. When in doubt, prefer the `incremental` materialization escape hatch over inlining -- see `references/transformation-matrix.md`.
- **`portal_source_count`, `datetime`, and `portal_partition_*` auto-inject** into CTEs whose `from` is a `model` or `cte`. Do not duplicate these columns in the new CTE's `select`; the framework appends them automatically from the upstream registry.
- **CTE column type inheritance.** Plain string selects in a CTE inherit `dim` / `fct` type from the upstream model or CTE -- no need to redeclare types when copying selects from the ephemeral.

## Worked example

**Before** -- ephemeral `int_join_models` consumed by one mart:

`models/intermediate/sales/orders/int__sales__orders__enriched.model.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "int_join_models",
  "group": "sales",
  "topic": "orders",
  "name": "enriched",
  // no materialization field -> defaults to ephemeral
  "from": {
    "model": "stg__sales__orders__standardized",
    "join": [
      {
        "model": "stg__customers__profiles__clean",
        "type": "left",
        "on": { "and": ["customer_id"] },
      },
      {
        "model": "stg__sales__stores__locations",
        "type": "left",
        "on": { "and": ["store_id"] },
      },
    ],
  },
  "select": [
    { "type": "all_from_model", "model": "stg__sales__orders__standardized" },
    {
      "type": "all_from_model",
      "model": "stg__customers__profiles__clean",
      "include": ["customer_name"],
    },
    {
      "type": "all_from_model",
      "model": "stg__sales__stores__locations",
      "include": ["store_name"],
    },
  ],
}
```

`models/mart/sales/reporting/mart__sales__reporting__revenue.model.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "mart_select_model",
  "group": "sales",
  "topic": "reporting",
  "name": "revenue",
  "from": { "model": "int__sales__orders__enriched" },
  "select": [
    { "type": "all_from_model", "model": "int__sales__orders__enriched" },
    {
      "name": "order_year",
      "expr": "EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)",
      "type": "dim",
    },
  ],
}
```

**After** -- ephemeral file deleted, mart now hosts the CTE. Note the CTE name is the **short** `"name"` field from the ephemeral (`enriched`), not the full `int__sales__orders__enriched`:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "mart_select_model",
  "group": "sales",
  "topic": "reporting",
  "name": "revenue",
  "ctes": [
    {
      "name": "enriched",
      "from": {
        "model": "stg__sales__orders__standardized",
        "join": [
          {
            "model": "stg__customers__profiles__clean",
            "type": "left",
            "on": { "and": ["customer_id"] },
          },
          {
            "model": "stg__sales__stores__locations",
            "type": "left",
            "on": { "and": ["store_id"] },
          },
        ],
      },
      "select": [
        {
          "type": "all_from_model",
          "model": "stg__sales__orders__standardized",
        },
        {
          "type": "all_from_model",
          "model": "stg__customers__profiles__clean",
          "include": ["customer_name"],
        },
        {
          "type": "all_from_model",
          "model": "stg__sales__stores__locations",
          "include": ["store_name"],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  "from": { "cte": "enriched" },
  "select": [
    { "type": "all_from_cte", "cte": "enriched" },
    {
      "name": "order_year",
      "expr": "EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)",
      "type": "dim",
    },
  ],
}
```

After saving, the file watcher debounces (~1500ms) and regenerates the mart's `.sql` / `.yml` automatically -- wait a few seconds, then verify the mart's diagnostics are clean. Once the full batch is applied, ask the user to run `DJ: Sync to SQL and YML` from the command palette for a project-wide pass. Only then -- and only after `rg int__sales__orders__enriched models/` returns zero hits -- delete `int__sales__orders__enriched.model.json` and its generated `.sql` / `.yml` siblings. Close the loop by asking the user to run `DJ: Sync to SQL and YML` once more (re-validates consumers against the post-delete state) and `DJ: Refresh Projects` (clears the deleted model from the dbt manifest).
